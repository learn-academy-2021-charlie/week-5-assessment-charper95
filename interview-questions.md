# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Rails follows an MVC pattern. What does that mean?

  Your answer: MVC stands for Model View Controller. It is a framework that gives a database a structure. It is essentially a way of organizing your code.

  Researched answer: MVC stands for Model View Controller. It is a framework that gives a database a structure. It is essentially a way of organizing your code. Model code refers to real-world things. It defines the essential component of your application. View code is made up of all the functions that the user interacts with. It defines how the user sees and interacts with the application. Controller code is a intermediary between Model code and View code. It receives input from the user and makes a decision about it.



2. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer: A relational database is a database that stores information in tables with rows & columns. There are other types of databases, such as a non-relational database.

  Researched answer: A relational database is a database that stores information in tables with rows & columns. There are other types of databases, such as a non-relational database like NoSQL databases that do not use the table of rows & columns structure. Some popular NoSQL database types are MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase and Apache HBase. The four popular non-relational types are document data store, column-oriented database, key-value store and graph database.



3. What is object-relational mapping?

  Your answer: ORM stands for object–relational mapping. It is used for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages like Ruby.

  Researched answer: ORM stands for object–relational mapping. It is used for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages like Ruby. Essentially it lets you query and manipulate data from a database using object-oriented programming languages like Ruby. It is specifically a library that encapsulates all the code needed to manipulate the data in your database instead of using SQL. It implements the Object-Relational Mapping technique and allows you to directly interact with an object in the language you are using, such as Ruby.



4. What is a gem?

  Your answer: A gem is a library or module that you can install and reuse in every project on your server.

  Researched answer: A gem is a library or module that you can install and reuse in every project on your server. It is a self-contained format in RubyGems the package manager for Ruby that allows you to distribute Ruby programs and libraries. Gems are used to distribute reusable functionality that can be shared with other ruby programmers to use in their apps.



5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer: A primary key is a column in a relational database that uniquely identifies a row in a table. They are important because you may have data that is the same that you want to be separate and unique. 

  Researched answer: A primary key is a column in a relational database that uniquely identifies a row in a table. A table can have only one primary key column which may have one or more fields. When there are multiple fields used as a primary key, they are called a composite key. They are important because you may have data that is the same that you want to be separate and unique. It is also important because it lets you query each row of a table individually by using its primary key value, and then modify those rows without affecting other rows.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: A RESTful route is a route that maps between HTTP verbs (Get, Put, Post, Delete), controller actions, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a database.

2. JSON: JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a file and data interchange format that uses text readable by humans to store and send object data that has key-value pairs.

3. ERB: ERB stands for Embedded RuBy. It is a feature of Ruby that allows you to generate any kind of text from templates. The templates combine plain text with Ruby code for variable substitution and flow control.

4. Params: Params is the parameter method in Rails. Params refers to the parameters being passed to the controller via a GET or POST request.

5. API: An API or Application Programming Interface is an intermediary between software and computers. It is a type of software interface. It allows two apps to talk to each toher.
